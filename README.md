# React Native WeatherApp

This is an application I created to test out React Native on Android and Desktop.
I use OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data and the OpenCageData API to get the current state,city,country from the location obtained with expo.

I have had previous experience with React but not React Native so this was a fun 1 day project!

A lot more can be improved upon such as nicer styles and onScroll/tap data points on the React-Native-Chart but I'm happy with the current iteration for a V1.
